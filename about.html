          The project was initiated by the Alaska Data Integration working group in 2012.
          ADIwg was formed in 2010 to address technical barriers regarding data sharing
          between organizations conducting scientific research in Alaska. In response to
          Alaska’s Arctic location and member organization’s frequent international research
          collaborations, ADIwg initiated development of metadata authoring tools for ISO
          19115+ with a design intention to collectively solve the problem for the community,
          such that all members benefit in transitioning to the ISO standard, whether single
          PIs or large organizations.

          Development has been carried out by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Alaska
          Science Center and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) Alaska Region, with
          support from respective parent bureaus. The first release was offered in 2016.

        <p class="fs-6 text-white">
          In 2021 a partnership agreement was established between three federal Dept. of
          Interior agencies: USGS, FWS and the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management
          (BOEM) to collaboratively support mdToolkit development. The three agencies intend
          to utilize mdToolkit as part of their technical solution for authoring and managing
          metadata in the ISO 19115+ standards. mdToolKit continues to be offered to the
          community at large.
